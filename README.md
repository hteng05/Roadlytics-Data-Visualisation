# Roadlytics – Road Safety Enforcement Data Visualisation

**Live Demo:** [https://hteng05.github.io/Roadlytics-Data-Visualisation/](https://hteng05.github.io/Roadlytics-Data-Visualisation/)

Roadlytics is an interactive web dashboard that visualises Australian road safety enforcement data from 2008 to 2023. The project focuses on three key areas: roadside drug testing, seatbelt enforcement, and related crash outcomes. Through the use of interactive charts and filters, users can explore spatial and temporal trends, compare jurisdictions, and gain insights into the effectiveness of road safety policies.

This project was developed as part of the 2025 Semester 1 Data Visualisation unit at Swinburne University, with an emphasis on visual storytelling, user experience, accessibility, and ethical data use.

## Features

- Interactive choropleth map showing drug test distribution across jurisdictions
- Bar and line charts visualising fines and positive test outcomes over time
- Pie charts and stacked bar charts for demographic and detection method breakdowns
- Filter controls for year, age group, jurisdiction, and location type
- Responsive and accessible interface for desktop and mobile use
- Integrated storytelling elements and structured layout for guided exploration

Roadlytics – Road Safety Enforcement Data Visualisation
Roadlytics is an interactive data visualisation website that presents key insights into roadside drug testing, seatbelt enforcement, and crash outcomes across Australia from 2008 to 2023. The dashboard allows users to explore spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns based on official enforcement data published by the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) and South Australian crash statistics.

The project was built for the 2025 Semester 1 Data Visualisation course, following best practices in chart design, accessibility, and web interactivity.

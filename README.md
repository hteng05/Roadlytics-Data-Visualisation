# Roadlytics – Road Safety Enforcement Data Visualisation

**Website:** [https://hteng05.github.io/Roadlytics-Data-Visualisation/](https://hteng05.github.io/Roadlytics-Data-Visualisation/)

**Roadlytics** is an interactive data visualisation platform that presents key insights into roadside drug testing, seatbelt enforcement, and crash outcomes across Australia from 2008 to 2023. The dashboard enables users to explore spatial, temporal, and demographic trends through official enforcement datasets published by the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) and South Australian crash statistics.

This project was developed for the **2025 Semester 1 Data Visualisation** course, with a focus on best practices in data storytelling, chart design, accessibility, and interactive web development.
